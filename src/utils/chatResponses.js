I built this little chat thing because, let's be real, regular resumes are kinda boring, right? Ask me literally anything - about my code adventures, that time I spent 6 hours debugging a missing semicolon, my weird coffee obsession, or how I somehow convinced companies to let me intern with them ðŸ˜…

Seriously though, I love talking about tech, projects, and pretty much anything else. What's on your mind?`;
